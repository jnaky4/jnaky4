Where I got wasn't very far. I had a lot of issued with my computer not wanting to open up the Pytest in a viewable IDE. I spent part of the time changing the default programs to open it. Overall I got to part 4 and didn't quite understand the concepts being brought up. I plan to dive into the documentation to clarify this, since it doesn't seem too complicated. The Test notation is very.... weird, the variable and naming convention isn't like anything I've seen before.
